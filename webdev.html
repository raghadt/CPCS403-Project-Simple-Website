        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          Web developers, sometimes called programmers, take the design created and build a fully functioning website. To put it (very) simply, think of the design as a non-interactive “picture” of a website. Developers take that design and break it up into it’s
          components. They then either use just HTML or a more dynamic approach incorporating programming languages such as PHP to develop the various website pages. More advanced web developers may choose to utilize a Content Management System (CMS)
          like WordPress or Joomla in order to streamline development and allow clients an easy way to maintain and update their website.</br>
